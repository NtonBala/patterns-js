# Decorator Pattern

Like [mixin](../mixins/index.md), [decorator pattern](https://monsterlessons.com/project/lessons/decorator-pattern-v-javascript) is an alternative to class inheritance.

Decorator allows to dynamically add new properties and methods to objects. That is, we kind of wrap our object in a decorator, like in a superclass.
